            Dubai was gaining popularity in recent years until the global economic crash of 2008. It is essentially a desert city with superb infrastructure and comparatively liberal policies (by regional standards). Boasting state-of-the-art tourist amenities, it quickly became popular and one of the most visited cities in the world. Just 5 h from Europe and 3 h from most parts of the Middle East, the Near East, and the subcontinent of India, Dubai makes a great short break for shopping, partying, sunbathing, fine dining, sporting events, and other tourists' activities. It is a city of superlatives. For the fastest, biggest, tallest, largest and highest, Dubai is the destination. It has the largest immigrant population in the world. Specifically, according to Dubai Statistics Center, out of its 2019 3,355,900 population, only 263,450 were Emiratis and that has been the fashion for years. The city's weekly day off is Friday. Note that since September 2006, a harmonised weekend of Friday and Saturday has been adopted for the public sector and schools. Government departments, multinational companies and most schools and universities now go off on Friday and Saturday (after years of a mixed bag of Friday/Saturday and Thursday/Friday weekends). Some local companies still work half a day on Thursday with a full day on Saturday, but larger companies tend to permit relaxation and time off work for their employees on Friday and Saturday.

One Emirates, many Peoples
Once you land in Dubai, you might not think it is an Arab city, given its cosmopolitan feel and its modern Western-styled architectures. When Dubai was in poor state before the exploration of oil, some Indians supplied technology for the development of it. Dubai has, since the founding of its oil industry, attracted thousands of migrants from all over the world notably from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. In this modern day, Indians and Filipinos have left their influence in the emirate: Indian restaurants and Pakistani bakeshops are everywhere while Filipino supermarkets are on the rise. Next to them the Europeans (mostly British and French) and Sri Lankans, form the next largest communities. Chinese and Indonesian migrants are on the rise. Many Arab countries have passed policies like the UAE's Emiratisation, which is a policy that prevents migrants from taking all the job opportunities and provides more jobs to local Emiratis.
