        British India's princely state of Jammu and Kashmir is now temporally divided between the Republic of India and Pakistan and China. The Government of India claims the entire area of the former state, whereas Pakistan regards the same area as "territory in dispute" awaiting a plebiscite. While some Kashmiris hope for an independent and unified Kashmiristan, the majority seem to simply want peace and to restore pre-1947 boundaries. It is a mountainous region of great beauty and diversity offering much in the way of outdoor activities and sights for the tourists. The unrest had pretty much completely shut down what was once a thriving tourist industry in Kashmir, and it’s now only starting to make a slow comeback. As a rule of thumb, the western area remains unsafe. Today, Indian-administered Kashmir is a Union Territory of India, although the Lakshadweep Islands as an administrative division entirely within India has a Muslim-majority status. It has an area of 39,179 mi² (101,473.1 km²).

        The inhabitants of J&K belong to three religions, with Kashmir being mainly Muslim, Jammu being mainly Hindu and the Ladakhis divided almost equally between Buddhists and Muslims.
